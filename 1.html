      I wanted to thank you for giving suggestion that "Jewellery is not in clarity" on that day. I worked on it, I got the above one, which is better than previous one. &#x1F603; 
      Thanks for your suggestion, without you, I couldn't update my algorithm and got 80% accuracy. &#128525;<br>
      I wanted to present this on your birthday. So, I didn't reveal to you. And I'm sorry for not gettting your necklace properly. &#x1F62C; <br>
      Hope you like this one..! &#128513;
