    <h1>What I think :) </h1>
    <p>
        Hey Himaja,<br>
        First thing is "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO U" and I wish you to celebrate more and more birthday like this every year.<br>
        To be frank, I wasn't knowing you till 10<sup>th</sup> standard. I still remember that you made some chai to me <br>
        and my dad, when i came to your home. After coming to my home, dad started comparing with you that "Learn from her <br>
        she got 10 points, y cant u study" all those things (Typical middle class family comparisions ;) ).Because of those <br>
        scoldings i still remember you.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Later on, I came after 12<sup>th</sup>, and I came to know that you shifted to Ananthapur.After 4 years,I saw you<br>
        near your home.I thought of speaking with u and ur mom, but due to health conditions I'm not able to do. I thought <br>
        atleast u will chat or reply to my messages, but u didn't, I dont know why.I thought u may have some work and all, <br>
        I took it positive way :). Anyway I never complaint on this, but all I can say or wish u as well wisher is to be happy.<br>
       "Neeku yeppudu yemi chepaledu, Eppudu chepadam thappa inka yemi ledu anthe...!"<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to make some photosmanic for last birthday, but I couldnt do it becz of time constraint, i came to know that<br>
        before two days so i could not make it, hope atleast u like this website, and please, I'm requesting you not to tell<br>
        your parents If you dont like it please tell me, I'll delete these webpages from server. And last I'm sorry for using your <br>
        pictures to make this website more beautiful.By using images, this website got colorful(its my feeling :) ).
        Last I want to add that, After you blocking me on WhatsApp I literally scared that if I share some memes or some messages on Instagram<br>
        I thought you block on Instagram also. So I'm somewhat fear to send message or meme to you. If you don't like to talk say to me, I won't bother you much<br>
        I know that you will feel weird to you by this website, All I can do to you is this much thats all Himaja anyway "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO U" <br>
        Thank you<br>
