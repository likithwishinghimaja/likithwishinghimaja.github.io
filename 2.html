        Hey Himaja,<br>
        First thing is "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO U" and I wish you to celebrate more and more birthday like this every year.<br>
        I dont know you are my relative until I finished my 10th. when I have completed my 10th,I and my dad came to ur home and we had spent some time.<br>
        To be frank, I don't know that time how we relate and I was little confuse how many relatives does we have and how should address them (what if we call mama as babai and babai as mama some weird feeling ri8.)<br>
        So, I asked later my dad how we relate and all he said. I remember you because my dad scolded me because you scored good marks in 10th (you know typical indian parents always obssed with other marks and start comparisions),<br>
        In that way i remember you and now also i think that you are very studious and goodd student.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Later..! When I came to 12<sup>th</sup>, Again me and my dad came to your home because of some work with Mallikarjuna mama.<br>
        I recalled you, I didn't saw you but I saw your bro when he came to mama home. After some chit-chats I got to know that you were taking medical coaching <br>
        and you shifted to ATP.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After geting my results of 12<sup>th</sup>, I was not in touch with YGR, So I don't know where were u and what you were doing. <br>
        In 2019, As I was making some experiments and doing repairs with mobiles (me and my dads). I got ur number, I was literally fearing of asking for you, <br> 
        that where were u and all. But, Some how I made courage and texted you. My fear was how you will react, what if you don't remember me and what if you complain abt me to your parents.<br>
        In 2020, You blocked me on WhatsApp, I was so feared, something had happend and all (I'm overthinker) thats why I didn't shared any memes or post at that time to you.<br>
        what if you block on instagram too.<br>
     </p>
    <p>
        I don't know, How you may react with this website, I know it's overrated to you, But still i hope u like it.<br>
        And Only thing I can gift or suprise with my knowledge is this and that too virtually :)<br>
        Two reasons for making this website<br>
        1."Nenu yeppudu niku yemi chepaledu. ippudu chepadaniki thappa yemi ledu"<br>
        2. If I text you, You may have some work or You may be busy, So I don't want to disturb u. But, In this way I can share my thoughts with you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Last but not least, I'm requesting you not to tell your parents If you dont like it please tell me, I'll delete these webpages from server.<br>
        And last I'm sorry for using your pictures to make this website more beautiful.By using images, this website got colorful(its my feeling :) ).<br>
        Anyway "Once Again HAPPY BIRTHDAY, STAY SAFE, STAY BLESSED and ROCK THIS DAY and THIS YEAR tooooo..!" <br>
        Thank you<br>
        Sai Himaja Dandu<br>
