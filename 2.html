        Hey Himaja, (42)<br>
        First thing is "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO U" and I wish you to celebrate more and more birthday like this every year.
        I dont know you are my relative until I finished my 10th. when I have completed my 10th,I and my dad came to ur home and we had spent some time.
        To be frank, I don't know that time how we relate and I was little confuse how many relatives does we have and how should address them (what if we call mama as babai and babai as mama some weird feeling ri8. &#x1F602;)
        So, I asked later my dad how we relate and all he said. I remember you because my dad scolded me because you scored good marks in 10th (you know typical Indian parents always obsessed with other marks and start comparisions &#x1F602;),
        In that way I remember you and now also i think that you are very studious and good student.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I still wonder that, We lived near for 16-17 years, But I was not aware of you, Until I came to your home..! So Strange..!
    </p>
    <p>
        Later..! When I came to 12<sup>th</sup>, Again me and my dad came to your home because of some work with Mallikarjuna mama.
        I recalled you, I didn't saw you but I saw your bro when he came to mama home. After some chit-chats I got to know that you were taking medical coaching 
        and you shifted to ATP.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After geting my results of 12<sup>th</sup>, I was not in touch with YGR, So I don't know where were u and what you were doing. 
        In 2019, As I was making some experiments and doing repairs with mobiles (me and my dads). I got ur number, I was literally fearing of asking for you, 
        that where were u and all. But, Some how I made courage and texted you. My fear was how you will react, what if you don't remember me and what if you complain abt me to your parents.
        In 2020, You blocked me on WhatsApp, I was so feared, something had happend and all (As I'm overthinker &#x1F605;) thats why I didn't shared any memes or post at that time to you.
        what if you block on Instagram too.<br>
     </p>
    
    <p>
        I don't know, How you may react with this website, I know it's overrated to you, But still I hope u like it.
        And Only thing I can gift or suprise with my knowledge is this and that too virtually &#x1F609;<br>
        Two reasons for making this website<br>
        1."Nenu yeppudu niku yemi chepaledu. ippudu chepadaniki thappa yemi ledu" &#x1F60D;<br>
        2. If I text you, You may have some work or You may be busy, So I don't want to disturb u. But, In this way I can share my thoughts with you &#x1F60D;<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Last but not least, I'm requesting you not to tell your parents If you dont like it please tell me, I'll delete these webpages from server.
        And I'm sorry for using your pictures to make this website more beautiful..!
        Anyway "Once Again HAPPY BIRTHDAY, STAY SAFE, STAY BLESSED and ROCK THIS DAY and THIS YEAR tooooo..!" ðŸ¥³<br>
        Thank you &#x1F497;<br>
